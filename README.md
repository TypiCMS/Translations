# Translations

Translations are stored in the database through the admin panel (/admin/translations).
You can get DB translations with ``` Lang::get('db.Key') ```, ``` __('db.Key') ``` or ``` @lang('db.Key') ```.

This module is part of [TypiCMS](https://github.com/TypiCMS/Base), a multilingual CMS based on the [Laravel framework](https://github.com/laravel/framework).
