# Translations

Translations are stored in the database through the admin panel (/admin/translations).  
You can get DB translations with ``` Lang::get('db.Key') ```, ``` trans('db.Key') ``` or ``` @lang('db.Key') ```.

This module is part of [TypiCMS](https://github.com/TypiCMS/Base), a multilingual CMS based on Laravel 5.
