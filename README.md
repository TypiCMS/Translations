# Translations

Translations are stored in the database through the admin panel (/admin/translations).
You can get DB translations with ``` trans('Key') ```, ``` __('Key') ``` or ``` @lang('Key') ```.

This module is part of [TypiCMS](https://github.com/TypiCMS/Base), a multilingual CMS based on the [Laravel framework](https://github.com/laravel/framework).
